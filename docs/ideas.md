## Innovative Idea

enRoute:

- Students can have trouble finding where to go during vacation periods. Our web app will make the vacation search easier for college students who are trying to find a place to go during Spring Break, Winter break, or long weekends. Keeping in mind the user’s budget, distance willing to travel, time period, and intended activities, we will use information from multiple destinations to cultivate the best top 10 locations according to the user’s request.

## Important Components
- We will have a filter that a user will fill with relevant information regarding date of trip, budget, and activity types. This information will be processed, and our application will give the best locations to travel on a map. This will be accompanied with events, hotels, restaurants, and other essentials given the search parameters.
